All requests require a header key for authorization.

## User object
The data stored for a user is
1. username
2. CPU core count
3. GPU
4. user agent
5. username banned flag
6. IP banned flag
7. IP address
8. ISO timestamp of the last time the object was updated

No duplicate usernames are allowed; core counts received that are not numbers are stored as `0`.
